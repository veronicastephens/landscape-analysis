### Project Goal
While firm leader on Confluence Park project, created grading and site plans
See San Antonio River Foundation website: https://sariverfound.org/confluence-park/

### Summary
Overall, landscape architecture projects must include spatial analysis. Analysis takes place in numerous areas, including proposed and existing: utility services, orientation of the project, prevailing wind direction, sun and shade patterns, topography, flow of surface and groundwater, soil composition, condition of trees and plants, viewsheds, and environmental factors. The grading and tree cover analysis are also subject to federal and local laws and ordinances. 

Within each project, these areas of analysis have a hierarchy of importance determined by project goals, strategy, and budget. This hierarchy serves as a framework for project decisions and design. The resulting overall site plans are based on spatial analysis.

### Results
Confluence Park had unique site goals and existing site conditions. At the confluence of the San Antonio River and the San Pedro Creek, the primary goals of the park are to serve as a gathering place and an outdoor classroom, educating the public about the five ecotypes of Texas. Each ecotype is represented in the park and is separated by paths and highlighted with distinct grading features. The park also aims to be energy and irrigation independent with the use of solar power panels and underground water collection and retention systems. The grading plan also connected the existing Mission Reach trail system along the San Antonio River. Overall, the grading, water collection and use, and ecotype plans connect the distinct architecture and landscape features of the site.

### Included
Grading plan, site diagrams, site plans, and project photographs

### Programs
AutoCAD, Revit, Adobe InDesign
